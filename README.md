# Air-Guardians
  **Application designed and developed by _The Guardians_ team including: [Flavius Stan](https://github.com/StanFlavius),  [Stefan Zaharia](https://github.com/stefzah),  [Anca Iordachescu](https://github.com/IordachescuAnca).**

## Description of application:
Android application written in Java that monitor air quality in some locations in Romania.

Air pollution is now the biggest environmental risk for out health, having various malign health effects in early human life such as such as respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal disorders. With the population in urban areas particularly exposed to high concentrations of pollutans that even if you can't see, they can still hurt you and produce damage to your health.

This is where technology comes in!

Air-Guardians application offers information about the level of pollutions and 5 pollutans carbone monixide, nitroge dioxide, ozone, inhalable particulate matter PM2.5 and PM10 that can be found in the city the customer choose. 

It is our belief that monitoring the air quality of the places protects people's life and health
and minimize exposure to outdoor air pollution as daily information about pollutants that can
be found in the air help people decide when to stay indoors.
