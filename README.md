  **Application designed and developed by _The Guardians_ team including: [Flavius Stan](https://github.com/StanFlavius),  [Stefan Zaharia](https://github.com/stefzah),  [Anca Iordachescu](https://github.com/IordachescuAnca).**

## Description of application:
Android Application which provides information about air quality in Bucharest. Based on live data transmitted from IoT sensors(temperature, light etc) that are situated in different places in the city, the app offers information about the level of pollution, the proprieties of air qualities and suggestions about types of plants that grow in that region. Using Machine Learning algorithms, it also provides information about air quality in the next 12 hours. If there are any zones in Bucharest where the level of pollution is over the maximum limit, the client gets a warning notification.
